1. Complete upper bound - Done
2. Include plots for simulations


% Plan - return to this



%%% Plots - Title, axis labels, caption (relatively short is fine)
%% Reference each figure in text.. \label{fig:regretvsTime...}
%% (see Figure \ref{fig:regretvsTime...}) 
%% Empirical results: (1) Describe the experiment at very high-level - motivation, (2) Detailed description of what you did (different algorithms, type of simulated data, number of trials) (3) Describing and analysing the results (possibly (4) some remarks about limitations and what else could be done in future work)...



%%% Future work 
%% E.g Shortest path
%% Mutliprocessing minimisation


%% Comma or full stop after every equation (full stop if it ends a sentence),
%% Check implies symbols
%% Be careful with over use of ":"
%% Check for "\log" vs "log".
